It says that Ornellining '1984' is a propaganda firm that promotes totalitarism. The question is about what manipulyatsiyasi looks like and how it's perceived by viewers.\n\nIn the context, it mentions that the manipulyatsiyasi \"qanday qilib ijtimoiy nazorat vositasi sifatida ishlaydi.\" That translates to \"How does the propaganda firm's manipulyatsiyasi look and how is it perceived by viewers?\"\n\nI think the key points here are the nature of the propaganda, its content, and how it's received.
